              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructor) UMKM
                recognizes a significant untapped potential in leveraging its
                customer base and aims to capitalize on this opportunity through
                strategic initiatives. To achieve this, the organization is
                planning to implement diverse approaches tailored to different
                customer segments by conducting comprehensive customer
                segmentation analysis. The goal is to gain a deeper
                understanding of each segment's unique characteristics and
                behaviors, allowing PADI UMKM to enhance overall business
                performance through targeted strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to customer-focused efforts, PADI UMKM is committed
                to supporting its sellers effectively. The organization
                acknowledges the importance of understanding the characteristics
                of its sellers to provide them with improved support. By gaining
                insights into the needs and challenges faced by sellers, PADI
                UMKM aims to develop strategies that facilitate better
                collaboration and ultimately contribute to the success of both
                the organization and its sellers. This dual-focus approach,
                involving both customer segmentation analysis and seller support
                initiatives, reflects PADI UMKM's commitment to a holistic and
                strategic approach for sustainable growth and success in the
                market.

              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>
                The current marketing strategy at PADI UMKM lacks a systematic
                approach to understanding and leveraging customer behavior,
                resulting in a missed opportunity for business growth. The
                absence of customer segmentation analysis has led to
                insufficient insights into the diverse characteristics and
                preferences of our customer base.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>

                <li>

                <li>

              <h3>Customer Retention Rate Results:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The retention rates generally decrease over time for each
                  cohort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The first cohort (2022-01) starts with a 100% retention rate,
                  as expected, and shows a significant drop to 52.6% in the
                  second month, followed by a gradual decline to 73% by the
                  twelfth month.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Subsequent cohorts also start with 100% retention in their
                  first month and show a similar trend of sharp decline in the
                  second month, with varying degrees of decrease in the
                  following months.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The retention rates for later months are generally lower,
                  indicating a decrease in customer retention as time
                  progresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The color gradient from dark blue to light green indicates
                  higher to lower retention rates, respectively.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Insights:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The sharp decline from the first to the second month across
                  all cohorts suggests that customer engagement initiatives
                  could be most impactful if implemented early in the customer
                  lifecycle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The varying retention rates in the later months across cohorts
                  suggest that some months may have specific factors affecting
                  retention, which could be investigated further.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Investigate the causes of the sharp decline after the first
                  month to develop targeted strategies for improving the
                  second-month retention.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Analyze customer behavior, feedback, and transaction patterns
                  to identify potential reasons for churn.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implement early engagement strategies, such as onboarding
                  programs, customer education, and initial promotions, to boost
                  retention in the early stages.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Consider personalized retention campaigns for customers who
                  have been with the company for longer periods, as their
                  retention rates tend to dwindle over time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Regularly track and analyze retention metrics to identify
                  trends and develop timely interventions.
                </li>
