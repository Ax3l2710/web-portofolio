									<h3>Background</h3>
             						 <p> PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructor) UMKM
                						recognizes a significant untapped potential in leveraging its
                						customer base and aims to capitalize on this opportunity through
                						strategic initiatives. To achieve this, the organization is
                						planning to implement diverse approaches tailored to different
                						customer segments by conducting comprehensive customer
                						segmentation analysis. The goal is to gain a deeper
                						understanding of each segment's unique characteristics and
                						behaviors, allowing PADI UMKM to enhance overall business
                						performance through targeted strategies.</p>
              						<p> In addition to customer-focused efforts, PADI UMKM is committed
                						to supporting its sellers effectively. The organization
                						acknowledges the importance of understanding the characteristics
                						of its sellers to provide them with improved support. By gaining
                						insights into the needs and challenges faced by sellers, PADI
                						UMKM aims to develop strategies that facilitate better
                						collaboration and ultimately contribute to the success of both
                						the organization and its sellers. This dual-focus approach,
                						involving both customer segmentation analysis and seller support
                						initiatives, reflects PADI UMKM's commitment to a holistic and
                						strategic approach for sustainable growth and success in the market.

									<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              						<p>
                					The current marketing strategy at PADI UMKM lacks a systematic
                					approach to understanding and leveraging customer behavior,
                					resulting in a missed opportunity for business growth. The
                					absence of customer segmentation analysis has led to
                					insufficient insights into the diverse characteristics and
                					preferences of our customer base.
              						</p>

									  <h3>Method</h3>
									  <ol>
										<li>Cohort Analysis</li>
										<li>Heat Map</li>
									  </ol>
									  
									  <h3>Customer Retention Rate Results:</h3>
									  <ol>
										<li>
										  The retention rates generally decrease over time for each
										  cohort.
										</li>
										<li>
										  The first cohort (2022-01) starts with a 100% retention rate,
										  as expected, and shows a significant drop to 52.6% in the
										  second month, followed by a gradual decline to 73% by the
										  twelfth month.
										</li>
										<li>
										  Subsequent cohorts also start with 100% retention in their
										  first month and show a similar trend of sharp decline in the
										  second month, with varying degrees of decrease in the
										  following months.
										</li>
										<li>
										  The retention rates for later months are generally lower,
										  indicating a decrease in customer retention as time
										  progresses.
										</li>
										<li>
										  The color gradient from dark blue to light green indicates
										  higher to lower retention rates, respectively.
										</li>
									  </ol>
						
									  <h3>Insights:</h3>
									  <ol>
										<li>
										  The sharp decline from the first to the second month across
										  all cohorts suggests that customer engagement initiatives
										  could be most impactful if implemented early in the customer
										  lifecycle.
										</li>
										<li>
										  The varying retention rates in the later months across cohorts
										  suggest that some months may have specific factors affecting
										  retention, which could be investigated further.
										</li>
									  </ol>
						
									  <h3>Recommendations:</h3>
									  <ol>
										<li>
										  Investigate the causes of the sharp decline after the first
										  month to develop targeted strategies for improving the
										  second-month retention.
										</li>
										<li>
										  Analyze customer behavior, feedback, and transaction patterns
										  to identify potential reasons for churn.
										</li>
										<li>
										  Implement early engagement strategies, such as onboarding
										  programs, customer education, and initial promotions, to boost
										  retention in the early stages.
										</li>
										<li>
										  Consider personalized retention campaigns for customers who
										  have been with the company for longer periods, as their
										  retention rates tend to dwindle over time.
										</li>
										<li>
										  Regularly track and analyze retention metrics to identify
										  trends and develop timely interventions.
										</li>
